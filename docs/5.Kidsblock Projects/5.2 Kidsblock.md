### 3.3 Load KidsBlock Library

⚠️ **ATTENTION** : If you drag and build code blocks yourself, you must manually add library of “web page editing PRO” and “Stepper”. The followings introduce how to load a library.

If you directly import the code file we provide, there is no need to add the library file as it will be automatically added when importing. So you can skip this part.

Open KidsBlock IDE and click ![Img](../img/Extension.png) to add extensions.

![Img](../img/Extension1.png)

 Search `Web Page Editing PRO` to load it.

![Img](../img/PRO1.png)

Similarly, load `Stepper`.
