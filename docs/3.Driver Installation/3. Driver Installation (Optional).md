# 3. Driver Installation (Optional)

*This section is not mandatory. It should only be used when the main board cannot be recognized by your computer. If it is, just skip this part!*

(Note: If the main board cannot be recognized in Arduino or kidsblock projects, please check whether the board is connected properly, or try other USB port on your computer. If it still does not work, follow these steps to install driver.)

## 3.1 For Windows System
